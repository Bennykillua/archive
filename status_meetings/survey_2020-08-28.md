- Translations and promotion succeeded in making the distributions of respondents global. US-based respondents were ~33% of the total.



**2. Analysis of the collected data**

*Deliverables:*
The survey final report will be presented using Jupyter Notebook as a separate web page linked to numpy.org.

*Topics to be examined and highlighted in the report:*
- stratify responses by experience level
- influence of gender
- corporate vs. science
- feature requests and pain points (from the verbatim comments)

*Timeline:* TBD



**3. Release of the collected data into the public domain**

After carefully examining all the options presented and discussed at the latest NumPy community meeting (see the minutes [here](https://github.com/numpy/archive/blob/master/status_meetings/status_2020-08-19.md)) as well as perusing the California Consumer Privacy Act A.B. 375 (https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180AB375) and GDPR (https://gdpr-info.eu), the Survey Team made the decision to take the following steps to protect the privacy of the survey respondents:

1. Coarsen the following data:
- age (group age by decades);
- the countries that are represented by less than 10 respondents will be designated as n/a.
2. Answers to the open-ended questions will be examined for sensitive personal info and released separately.



**4. Storage of the data set released into the public domain**

The following options were considered:
1. Saving on Google Drive, no sign-in required.

Case studies:
- PSF (conducted by JetBrains): https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/python-developers-survey-2019/
- Stack Overflow: https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey

2. Collecting some personal information via a form and sending to the provided email address a link to the data set. This option would allow to monitor access to the survey data.

Case studies:
- Anaconda (access to the report only): https://www.anaconda.com/state-of-data-science-2020

The first option was chosen as there is no need to monitor access to the collected data.



# Action Items

- Ross will start with the general aggregation/creating a notebook and static website.
- Ralf will look at some(?) freeform answers.
- Stephanie will take a first pass at preparing raw data for release.
- Inessa will write the first draft of the formal survey report.
