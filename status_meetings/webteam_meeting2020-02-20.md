**Present:** Shaloo, Inessa


# Agenda

1. Status of the new website.
2. Status of content creation.
3. Status of translations with Crowdin.
4. Make a tentative roll-out plan.
5. Presentation resources (templates, infographics and other visual materials).


# Meeting Minutes
## 1. Content

There are no urgent dependencies on the content from Shaloo for the upcoming website launch. However, she will continue to work on other case studies (e.g. sports analytics).

## 2. NumPy.org (Hugo generated)
**team.md page**

Ideas from Shaloo:
 - to have live data, e.g. a dot on the world map, displaying NumPy activities (e.g. downloads, something related to GitHub activities) across the globe;
 - feature the NumPy key contributors (based on Issue 45 https://github.com/numpy/numpy.org/issues/45)

She will do more research after completing the case studies.
 
**Review of the latest version of numpy.org**

Shaloo screenshared the latest. The tiles of the case studies are not centered on Safari. Here is the screenshot:

Interestingly, they look centered on Safari for Inessa. The screenshot from Inessa is below:

## 3. Rollout plan

**Tentative release date:** March, 15th

**Touch base:** March, 6-7th


## Action Items
*Shaloo:*
- Share examples of consoles/terminals/shells on other websites.
- Share ideas for a snippet of the NumPy code (3-10 lines) to place in the shell on the homepage. 
- Share ideas for a NumPy tutorial to be placed above the homepage terminal. 
- Share ideas for a live counter on the home page. Maybe it could be placed in the bottom left corner.
