# 2021-12-15 NumPy Development Meeting -- Triage

Note: we alternate between [community meetings](https://hackmd.io/76o-IxCjQX2mOXO_wwkcpg) and triage meetings.

- Time: 17:30 UTC
- Join via Zoom at https://berkeley.zoom.us/j/762261535 (or [dial-in](https://berkeley.zoom.us/u/aC3ENhycM))
- [Previous community meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/status_meetings)
- [Previous triage meetings](https://github.com/numpy/archive/tree/master/triage_meetings)


**Present:** 


## Triage

* [PRs and issues labelled with "Triage-Review"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/Triage-review) (please add)

* [PRs and issues labeled with "needs decision"](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/labels/54%20-%20Needs%20decision) (50 open)

* [Open PRs (>250 open)](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pulls) can we get this below 200?


## Followup

- `np.float128` - let's deprecate the name and leave `np.longdouble`. At some point we may be able to deprecate `np.longdouble`
- `ndarray.__format__` implementation for numeric dtypes [GH#19550](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19550)

## Topics

* Removal of stack-allocated arrays? See https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/20456
  - Should be discussed directly with the HPy people

* It would be nice to get rc2 out this weekend, the weekened after should be OK.

* old proposal for `__format__`: https://gist.github.com/gustavla/2783543be1204d2b5d368f6a1fb4d069
  * new PR: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/19550
  * Sebastian: Will try to float it to the mailing list, I am not sure there was a good reason this got stuck, except the question of "should containers format with {:f}", and there is probably no prior art for this? 

* NEP: Making details of np.core private: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/11924

* ENH: Add support for PEP 3118 buffers with offsets (non-contiguous): https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/7467

* Adding logical gufuncs, ie all_equal: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/8528


* Update pavement.py to sign release notes: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/6496

* Merge generalized linear algebra routines into numpy.linalg: https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/3217
