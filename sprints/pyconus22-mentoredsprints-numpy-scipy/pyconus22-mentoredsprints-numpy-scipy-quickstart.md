# PyCon US'22 Mentored Sprints - NumPy & SciPy

The main purpose of this sprint is to help newcomers contribute to NumPy & SciPy.

To join Mentored Sprints Discord, follow the link: https://t.co/zTrfEb4Mzh.

## NumPy


### Helpful resources*

- [Contributing to NumPy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/index.html)
- [Using gitpod for NumPy development](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/development_gitpod.html)
- [Building from source](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/building.html)
- [Building the documentation](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/howto_build_docs.html)

*Please help us improve these resources by submitting your suggestions in a corresponding issue tracker.

### Choosing an issue

The issues tagged `sprint` are relatively self-contained and a fairly good starting point for learning your way through NumPy building and bug fixing.

## SciPy

**[Issues labelled `sprint` on the SciPy issue tracker](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Asprint)** is a mix of code (mostly Python-level) and documentation issues selected for today's sprint.

If you do not see a suitable issue or you are interested in a particular SciPy submodule, please look at the relevant submodule label or ask a mentor for a suggestion.


### Guides

#### [SciPy Contributing documentation](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/contributor/contributor_toc.html)
The following documentation will help you set up and build a local development environment:
* [Fork and configuration of SciPy repository](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/gitwash/development_setup.html)
* [Contributor quickstart guide](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/dev_quickstart.html)
* [Complete build instructions](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/contributor/contributor_toc.html#development-environment)
* As an aternative, use the SciPy Gitpod setup _(this works without having to install anything, get to coding straight away in the browser!)_. Find more information in [the SciPy Gitpod docs](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/contributor/quickstart_gitpod.html#quickstart-gitpod).


* General guidelines for contributing:
    - Read through the recommended [development workflow](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/contributor/development_workflow.html#development-workflow).
    - Read through how-to [guide to contributing to SciPy documentation](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/howto-docs.html) (same as NumPy).

## Get sprinting (aka fixing issues and submitting PRs)!

* Please comment on the issue that you are working on to avoid multiple people taking on the same issue. 

* There are *a lot of* issues :sweat:! If you search for an issue not labelled `sprint`, it is recommended to pick one that is relatively new and doesn't have too many comments on it. (Old issues are often difficult to solve or unresolvable which is why they still remain.)

* The selections labelled `sprint` are focused on beginner-to-intermediate-friendly issues that are actionable and should be doable today. If you want to take on something a little more challenging, there are a lot of issues in the main repos to choose from. Try to choose issues that (from the title or labels) seem to be bugs, and don't have more than 5 comments - those are most likely to be actionable.

#### Documentation issues

If you are working on documentation, remember to check against https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/index.html or https://numpy.org/devdocs/index.html. This is the version of the documentation corresponding to the latest development version (aka what is merged on the main branch on GitHub).

#### How to co-author commits

If you worked in a pair/group and would like to acknowledge multiple authors on the PR, find some helpful documentation [here.](https://gist.github.com/lisawolderiksen/f9747a3ae1e58e9daa7d176ab98f1bad)

#### Labelling commit messages

Commit messages should be clear and follow a few basic rules. Please try to label your commits with an indicative label. Here are the guides for
- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/devdocs/dev/development_workflow.html#writing-the-commit-message)
- [SciPy](https://scipy.github.io/devdocs/dev/contributor/development_workflow.html#writing-the-commit-message)
